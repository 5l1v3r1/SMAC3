Introduction

.. _introduction:

*SMAC* stands for **Sequential Modelbased Algoritm Configuration** and uses
bayesian optimization to configure the hyperparameters of an algorithm. Instance
features can be used to optimize the algorithm on a certain set of instances.

There are two ways to use *SMAC*:

- You can use the `commandline <>`_, to optimize algorithms that are invoked via
  a bash-command,
- but you can also use *SMAC* `directly in Python <>`_.

We provide examples for the usage of *SMAC* in the `Quickstart`_-guide.

*SMAC* is written in Python and hosted on `GitHub
<https://github.com/automl/SMAC3/>`_.

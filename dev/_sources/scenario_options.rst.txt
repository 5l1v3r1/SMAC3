    * *abort_on_first_run_crash*: If true, *SMAC* will abort if the first run of the target algorithm crashes. Default: True.
    * *algo*: Specifies the target algorithm call that *SMAC* will optimize. Interpreted as a bash-command.
    * *always_race_default*: Race new incumbents always against default configuration.
    * *cost_for_crash*: Defines the cost-value for crashed runs on scenarios with quality as run-obj. Default: 2147483647.0.
    * *cutoff_time*: Maximum runtime, after which the target algorithm is cancelled. **Required if *run_obj* is runtime.**
    * *deterministic*: If true, the optimization process will be repeatable.
    * *execdir*: Specifies the path to the execution-directory. Default: ..
    * *feature_file*: Specifies the file with the instance-features.
    * *initial_incumbent*: DEFAULT is the default from the PCS. Default: DEFAULT. Must be from: ['DEFAULT', 'RANDOM'].
    * *input_psmac_dirs*: For parallel SMAC, multiple output-directories are used.
    * *instance_file*: Specifies the file with the training-instances.
    * *intensification_percentage*: The fraction of time to be used on intensification (versus choice of next Configurations). Default: 0.5.
    * *maxR*: Maximum number of calls per configuration. Default: 2000.
    * *memory_limit*: Maximum available memory the target algorithm can occupy before being cancelled.
    * *minR*: Minimum number of calls per configuration. Default: 1.
    * *output_dir*: Specifies the output-directory for all emerging files, such as logging and results. Default: smac3-output_2017-07-06_07:52:26_(837749).
    * *overall_obj*: PARX, where X is an integer defining the penalty imposed on timeouts (i.e. runtimes that exceed the *cutoff-time*). Default: par10.
    * *paramfile*: Specifies the path to the PCS-file.
    * *run_obj*: Defines what metric to optimize. When optimizing runtime, *cutoff_time* is required as well. Must be from: ['runtime', 'quality'].
    * *runcount_limit*: Maximum number of algorithm-calls during optimization. Default: inf.
    * *shared_model*: Whether to run SMAC in parallel mode.
    * *test_instance_file*: Specifies the file with the test-instances.
    * *tuner-timeout*: Maximum amount of CPU-time used for optimization. Default: inf.
    * *wallclock_limit*: Maximum amount of wallclock-time used for optimization. Default: inf.
